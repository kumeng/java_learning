# Color Thief - A Fast Java Implementation

Grabs the dominant color or a representative color palette from an image.

A very fast Java port of Lokesh Dhakar's JavaScript version (http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/).

This version is more than 40 times faster than the Java port at https://github.com/soualid/java-colorthief. Average times to extract the palette of the sample images (on a Core i7-2670QM):
* https://github.com/soualid/java-colorthief: 29.84 ms
* This version: 0.712 ms
